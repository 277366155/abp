## About This Tutorial

> In this tutorial, you will use the [ABP Suite](../../suite/index.md) to generate everything you need to build the **BookStore** application, such as [*Entities*](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/entities.md), [*Domain Services*](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/domain-services.md), [*Application Services*](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/application-services.md), *CRUD pages* and more... 

In this tutorial series, you will build an ABP based web application named `Acme.BookStore`. This application is used to manage a list of books and their authors. It is developed using the following technologies:

* **{{DB_Value}}** as the database provider.
* **{{UI_Value}}** as the UI Framework.

This tutorial is organized as the following parts:

- [Part 1: Creating the Solution](part-01.md)
- [Part 2: Creating the Books](part-02.md)
- [Part 3: Creating the Authors](part-03.md)
- [Part 4: Book to Author Relation](part-04.md)
- [Part 5: Customizing the Generated Code](part-05.md)
